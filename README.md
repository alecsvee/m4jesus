# M4Jesus

Agencies advertise through their own websites and efforts and word of mouth. Currently young people will hear an announcement from their church and some churches have ‘mission month’. 
 
M4Jesus is a platform for young people to explore Missions offered by the Mission agencies and Churches and match their passion and gifting to find the right Missions fit or Mission agencies they can serve with (ie matchmaking millennials to the Missions agencies).
